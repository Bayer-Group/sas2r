# ocs.early.sas2r
Early experimentations for github + bookdown that will eventually translate for our SAS2R cataloge

Let's try the following:

`dev` - contains only the work we do on the Rmd files (i.e. source)

`main` - whenever we're finished work, we'll knit and store the HTML here for serving via GH Pages

Eventually this will be CI/CD, but for now, let's get started on the *content* for the open source version of the book

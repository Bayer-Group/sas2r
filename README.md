# SAS2R 

The intent of this resource is to act as a knowledge hub for using R in a clinical study context. As our industry begins to embrace open-source languages like R, the need to replicate common analysis and reporting tasks or workflows is crucial to productivity. We appreciate that learning a new language can be challenging. Therefore, we aim to make the transition to R as effortless as possible by providing concrete examples relevant to clinical study programming. 

All code snippets in this resource can be used independently, they just need to be adjusted to your data. Basic familiarity with R is assumed. This resource is likely not to be exhaustive as we see it more as a living document for which we encourage cross-industry collaboration.

If you would suggest any content be added or amended, or have questions or feedback, we kindly request that you [open an issue](https://github.com/bayer-int/ocs.sas2r/issues).

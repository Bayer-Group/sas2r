Your collaboration is welcome.

## Use {renv}

{renv} ensures consistent package version for collaborating on this document. Right after you pull this repository, run `renv::restore()` to rehydrate your local project with necessary dependencies. 

Current package versions in the renv lockfile: 

```{r echo=FALSE}
local({
  renv_lock <- 
    as.data.frame(do.call(rbind,
                          lapply(jsonlite::read_json("renv.lock")$Packages, 
                                 function(x){
                                   c(name = unname(unlist(x[["Package"]])), 
                                     version = unname(unlist(x[["Version"]])))
                                 })))  
  
rownames(renv_lock) <- NULL
renv_lock  
})
```


If you think a package should be updated or newly included, reflect this information in `renv.lock` through `renv::snapshot()` and include it in your pull request.

You can use anything that Pandocs Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select All formats if youd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, youll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in Preview book, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["hello-bookdown.html", "Chapter 2 Hello bookdown 2.1 A section", " Chapter 2 Hello bookdown All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section. "],["cross.html", "Chapter 3 Cross-references 3.1 Chapters and sub-chapters 3.2 Captioned figures and tables", " Chapter 3 Cross-references Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 3.1 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 3.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure!

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2022) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.

If youd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your books title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your books source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapters source file.
